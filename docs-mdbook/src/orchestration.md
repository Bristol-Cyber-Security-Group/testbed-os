## Limitations

Be aware that if you do use sudo, the files created may required elevated permissions to use so you will there-on need to continue to use sudo unless you manually edit the owner (`chown`) or permissions (`chmod`).

If you use kvm-compose up with or without sudo, if you are using cloud-init images, then be aware that the images downloaded will either go to ``/root/.kvm-compose/`` if you use sudo or ``/home/<your home folder/.kvm-compose/`` if you do not.
This means that you may end up downloading the images twice, once in each folder if you interchange the use of sudo.
