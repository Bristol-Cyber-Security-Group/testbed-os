Resource Monitoring
===================

The testbed offers resource monitoring for the testbed hosts that are part of the cluster and for the testbed guests deployed via the testbed.
We use Prometheus as the time series database to store metrics data and Grafana to display the data from the database.
The dashboards are also available via the GUI under the respective deployment view pages.
